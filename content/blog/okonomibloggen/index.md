### Project Description

The task for this project was to design a complete brand identity for a Norwegian online finance blog. The identity consists of logo design, color palette, typography and design elements for use in social media. In addition, a website was designed and developed to construct a gathering place for all articles from Økonomibloggen. It was especially important to bring out financial concepts in a visual way so that the articles are easy to read and engaging.
