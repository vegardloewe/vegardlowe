### Project Description

This project involved designing promotional items and roll-up for the technology company Arveng Technologies. The promotional items will be used at conferences and international technology gatherings.

#### About Arveng Technologies

Arveng Technologies makes a glove with sensors on each finger to map the movement of the hand. The data is used to construct a 3D model of the hand, which will recognize different hand gestures and form the foundation that can be used to control machines. In this way, the cognitive capacity required by the user will be minimized.
