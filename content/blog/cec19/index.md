### Project Description

The task for this project was to design a complete visual brand identity for a Norwegian entrepreneurship conference. The idea was to create a conference identity that was based on the connection between Norway and China, at the same time as the identity focuses on start-ups. During the China Entry Challenge, Norway's top start-up companies will compete to win coveted prizes.

#### About China Entry Challenge

The Chinese market is expanding and start-up companies' connection to the market is becoming more and more valuable. China will take over the place of the United States as the world's largest retail market in 2019, according to a new market report published by the research agency eMarketer. China Entry Challenge introduces growing start-ups to the Chinese market and encourages them to take the next big step by inviting participants to the infamous start-up program China Start under the auspices of CKGSB.
